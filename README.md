# Minimax-Kernel-Machine-Learning-for-a-Class-of-Doubly-Robust-Functionals
This is the public code of the paper "Minimax Kernel Machine Learning for a Class of Doubly Robust Functionals with Application to Proximal Causal Inference" by Ghassami et al. (2022) published in AISTATS

We have appended here code of simulation for regular case, higher dimensional case and nonlinear case.
